System specific notes# On the Grex local software stack, we have VASP 5 and VASP 6 using Intel compiler and OpenMPI 3.</description></item><item><title>Modules and software stacks</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/using-modules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/using-modules/</guid><description>Introduction# On a Linux server or a Linux desktop, software can be installed in one of the standard locations, such as /usr/bin. This is where most of the system-level software binaries can be found. For custom usr user-built software it is a good practice to install it separately from the standard location, to avoid potential conflicts and make changes and uninstallation possible. One of the common locations would be under /usr/local/, as ib /usr/local/My_Custom_software/ , or under /opt (/opt/My_Other_custom_software).</description></item><item><title>Using Python for ML on Grex</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/specific-soft/python-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/specific-soft/python-ai/</guid><description>Introduction# Python is a dynamic language with many optional Library &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; available. Moreover, Python is often used as a &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; language for interacting with tools and libraries written in other languages (C/C++, Fortran, CUDA, etc.). This makes maintenance of Python software difficult. Not only do Python and libraries need to be of the right versions, but also other software they depend on should be of the same versions that have been used to build the corresponding packages.</description></item><item><title>Code Development on Grex</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/code-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/code-development/</guid><description>Introduction# Grex comes with a sizable software stack that contains most of the software development environment for typical HPC applications. This section of the documentation covers the best practices for compiling and building your own software on Grex.
The login nodes of Grex can be used to compile codes and to run short interactive and/or test runs. All other jobs must be submitted to the batch system. We do not do as heavy resource limiting on Grex login nodes as, for example, Compute Canada does; so, code development on login nodes is entirely possible.</description></item><item><title>Containers for Software</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/containers/</guid><description>Introduction# Linux Containers are means to isolate software dependencies from the base Linux operating system. On Grex, we support the Singularity container system, developed by a company called SyLabs. There was a fork of the Singularity project that produced a new project called Apptainer . As of early 2024, Singularity-CE by Sylabs and Apptainer by Linux Foundations are using the same SIF image format and thus are largely the same with respect to their usage and main features.</description></item><item><title>CVMFS and the Alliance software stack</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/cern-vmfs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/cern-vmfs/</guid><description>CC CernVMFS on Grex# CVMFS or CernVM FS stands for CernVM File System. It provides a scalable, reliable and low-maintenance software distribution service. CVMFS was originally developed to assist High Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations to deploy software on the worldwide-distributed computing infrastructure used to run data processing applications. Since then it has been used as a a generic way of distributing software. Presently, we use CernVMFS (CVMFS) to provide the Alliance&amp;rsquo;s (or Compute Canada&amp;rsquo;s) software stack.</description></item><item><title>How to use Jupyter notebooks on Grex?</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/jupyter-notebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/jupyter-notebook/</guid><description>Jupyter on Grex# Jupyter is a Web-interface aimed to support interactive data science and scientific computing. Jupyter supports several dynamic languages, most notably Python, R and Julia. Jupyter offers a metaphor of &amp;ldquo;computational document&amp;rdquo; that combines code, data and visualizations, and can be published or shared with collaborators.
Jupyter can be used either as a simple, individual notebook or as a multi-user Web server/Interactive Development Environment (IDE), such as JupyterHub/JupyterLab. The JupyterHub servers can use a variety of computational back-end configurations: from free-for-all shared workstation to job spawning interfaces to HPC schedulers like SLURM or container workflow systems like Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Running jobs on Grex</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/running-jobs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/running-jobs/</guid><description>Why running jobs in batch mode?# There are many reasons for adopting a batch mode for running jobs on a cluster. From providing user&amp;rsquo;s computations with fairness, traffic control to prevent resource congestion and wasting, enforcing organizational priorities, to better understanding the workload, utilization and resource needs for future capacity planning; the scheduler provides it all. After being long-time PBS/Moab users, we have switched to the SLURM batch system since December 2019 with the Linux/SLURM update project .</description></item><item><title>Software and Applications</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/</guid><description>Software# In the HPC world, software is more often meant as codes that do some scientific or engineering computation, data processing and visualization (as opposed to web services, relational databases, client-server business systems, email and office, &amp;hellip; etc.)
Tools and libraries used to develop HPC software are also software, and have several best practices associated with them. Some of that will be covered below. Without means to provide software to do computations, HPC systems would be rather useless.</description></item><item><title>Software Specific Notes</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/specific-soft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/specific-soft/</guid><description>Software specific notes# This page refers to the usage of some specific programs installed on Grex, like ORCA, VASP, &amp;hellip; etc.
