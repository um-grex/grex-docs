Such tools are: text editors, image viewers, file managers, &amp;hellip; etc.
Command line Text editors# Command line text editors allow you to edit files right on Grex in any terminal session (such as SSH session or an X terminal under OOD):
The (arguably) most popular editor is vi, or vim. It is very powerful, but requires some experience to use it.</description></item><item><title>Modules and software stacks</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/using-modules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/using-modules/</guid><description>Introduction# On a Linux server or a Linux desktop, software can be installed in one of the standard locations, such as /usr/bin. This is where most of the system-level software binaries can be found. For custom user-built software it is a good practice to install it separately from the standard location, to avoid potential conflicts and make changes and uninstallation possible. One of the common locations would be under /usr/local/, as in /usr/local/My_Custom_software/ , or under /opt (/opt/My_Other_custom_software).</description></item><item><title>Using Python for ML on Grex</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/specific-soft/python-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/specific-soft/python-ai/</guid><description>Introduction# Python is a dynamic language with many optional Library &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; available. Moreover, Python is often used as a &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; language for interacting with tools and libraries written in other languages (C/C++, Fortran, CUDA, etc.). This makes maintenance of Python software difficult. Not only do Python and libraries need to be of the right versions, but also other software they depend on should be of the same versions that have been used to build the corresponding packages.</description></item><item><title>Code Development on Grex</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/code-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/code-development/</guid><description>Introduction# Grex comes with a sizable software stack that contains most of the software development environment for typical HPC applications. This section of the documentation covers best practices for compiling and building your own software on Grex.
On Grex, login nodes can be used to compile software and to run short interactive and/or test runs. All other jobs must be submitted to the batch system. User sessions on the login nodes are limited by cgroups to prevent resource congestion.</description></item><item><title>Containers for Software</title><link>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://um-grex.github.io/grex-docs/software/containers/</guid><description>Introduction# Linux Containers are means to isolate software dependencies from the base Linux operating system. Several different Linux container engines exist, most notably Docker which was first to emerge as the most popular tool in the DevOps community.
Since then, a lot of work had been done by major Linux players like Google, RedHat and others to develop an open standard for container runtimes, which developed based on Docker, OCI .</description></item></channel></rss>
