## Introduction
---

We are pleased to provide a "pilot", starting Apr 2026, for [Nextcloud Files](https://nextcloud.com/files/), an Open Source, Dropbox-like storage service, for all Grex users. You can use your Grex ( CCDB ) username and password to log in to the [https://nextcloud.hpc.umanitoba.ca](https://nextcloud.hpc.umanitoba.ca) server. 

Nextcloud files allow for accessing your data from a Web Interface, command line tools like RClone, and a Desktop client on MacOS or Windows. 

* __Server URL:__ https://nextcloud.hpc.umanitoba.ca
* __Server Location:__ High Performance Computing Centre (HPCC), University of Manitoba.
* __Fixed Quota:__ 100 GB per user.
* __Backup Policy:__ Weekly on-site tape backup.
* __Access Methods:__ Web interface, Nextcloud Desktop Sync Client, Nextcloud mobile apps, RClone, WebDAV clients.
* __Documentation:__ [PDF](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/33/Nextcloud_User_Manual.pdf) and [online](https://docs.nextcloud.com/)

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
As of now, for the Pilot stage of the Service, the quota is __100 GB__ per user. The quota per user may change depending on the demand, available space and the Nextcloud's performance.

### Security and compliance

Similar to [OOD](ood) and all other services on Grex, accessing Nextcloud requires authentication with [MFA](connecting/mfa). The Nextcloud is using Grex's storage, and thus all the data is hosted in the HPCC datacentre at UManitoba. All data transfers between local devices and Grex's Nextcloud instance are encrypted with SSL/TLS. 

> Note that this Nextcloud instance is using the same storage as Grex's main storage, and therefore has same levels of security and privacy compliance. Grex storage is not certified for higher-security data such as non-anonymized data involving Health information, research including human participants, etc. . Please refer to UManitoba's Data Classification and your Research Ethics Board in case you have questions. Generally, do not put data to the Grex's Nextcloud that you would not put on Grex via SSH or OOD.

## Connect to Nextcloud 

The Nextcloud service can be connected to in several ways: 

 * Files can be uploaded, downloaded, shared and published via URL, uisng the Web Interface
 * Desktop clients allow for a convenient, automatic synchronization of directories, Dropbox-style
 * Data transfer clients that support WebDAV protocol (like RClone and Cyberduck.io) would be able to access Nextcloud Files

When using Nextcloud for the first time, we generally recommend users to access it through the Web interface as follows.

 1. Point your Web browser to [nextcloud.hpc.umanitoba.ca](https://nextcloud.hpc.umanitoba.ca). This will redirect you to our Keycloack IDP screen.
 2. Use your Grex (Alliance/CCDB) username and password to log in to Grex Nextcloud.
{{< collapsible title="Use your Alliance username and password to log in to Grex Nextcloud." >}}

{{< /collapsible >}}
 3. Provide your Alliance’s Duo  second factor authentication when asked.
 4. Once connected, the interface shows the following view:
{{< collapsible title="Nextcloud interface." >}}
![MFA second factor](/nextcloud/nextcloud-view.png)
{{< /collapsible >}}

The Web interace then allows for uploading, downloading and sharing files. 

Note that the same  connection/authentication sequence would be needed for setting up synchronizarion of Desktop clients.

### How to use Nextcloud Web interface?

To open the web interface, log in to [Grex Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.hpc.umanitoba.ca) from a web browser using your Grex (the Alliance) username and password as described above. Once connected to Nextcloud interface, use the menu __+New__ and its sub-menus can be to upload file or folders:

{{< collapsible title="Upload files or folders to Nextcloud." >}}
![MFA second factor](/nextcloud/nextcloud-upload.png)
{{< /collapsible >}}

Once you have your data uploaded to Nextcloud, it is possible to download the data and also share files with other users.

To download data, navigate through your data and select the file or the directory to download and use the menu __Download__:

{{< collapsible title="Download files or folders to Nextcloud." >}}
![MFA second factor](/nextcloud/nextcloud-download.png)
{{< /collapsible >}}

When downloading a directory (for example with the name _TEST_), Nextcloud will save it on your local machine as a _zip_ archive (in this case, the file will be _TEST.zip_).

The files and directories on Nextcloud can be shared with other users. In the Web interface, click to the "Sharing options" next to an object (File or Folder):

{{< collapsible title="Share files or folders with other users." >}}
![MFA second factor](/nextcloud/nextcloud-share.png)
{{< /collapsible >}}
You can now set the access options for the selected object and create a public link URL to it, to share with your collaborators, or with the entire World.

> Note that it is up to the researcher to make sure they follow the University's Security Policies and Data Classification Standard when sharing information outside of the University.

## Desktop (and mobile) Nextcloud clients

Nextcloud Files provide free Desktop clients for MacOS, Windows 10+ , and Linux (via Appimage). [Nextcloud Files clients](https://nextcloud.com/install/#desktop-files) allow to sync local and remote foldes, so that changes between the local folder and your Nextcloud service would happen automatically. 

The following steps are to setup a Desktop client on MacOS:

 1. Download the appropriate Desktop client for Mac. The Desktop installers are available from the Nextcloud [website](https://nextcloud.com/install/#desktop-files).
 1. Install the Desktop client using the installer you downloaded in the first step. The client installs a MacOS Panel app (top right corner) that runs as a service and provides the synchronization.
 1. Launch the Desktop client from your Mac. This will ask you to login. In the field _Server address_ put the URL for Grex Nextcloud and follow the instructions. 
{{< collapsible title="Desktop client." >}}

{{< /collapsible >}}
 1. The above will open a page in your browser and asks you to log in/ connect to your account as shown in the following screenshot:
{{< collapsible title="Link the Desktop client to your Nextcloud account." >}}
![MFA second factor](/nextcloud/nextcloud-link-account.png)
{{< /collapsible >}}

Afer granting access, your account will be linked to your Nextcloud account on Grex. A location for Nextcloud will be added to your Mac. It should be visible from the Finder's menu bar. It can be used to access your Nextcloud account, and will be able to be automatically synchronized.

{{< collapsible title="Access Nextcloud from Desktop client." >}}
![MFA second factor](/nextcloud/nextcloud-access-menu.png)
{{< /collapsible >}}
   
From this menu, you can access Nextcloud settings by clicking on the "down" arrow, and see your data synchronization status. 
The "Files", "Dashboard" and "Activity" items there actually open the Web interface; but the Folder-looking icon there, opens local folder in the MacOS Finder.

If you use your MacOS Finder and go to the Nextcloud folder on your Mac, you can work on that directory and the changes will be synced automatically to your Nextcloud folder on Grex. 

The Nextcloud mobile clients were not addressed here. If needed, please refer to the officila documentation of Nextcloud. Generally, the clients for iOS or Android would be available on the corresponding app-store/marketplace of the mobile OS vendor.

 * Note that it may take some time to synchronize all the data. In general, to avoid frequent data transfers and associated delays, it is possible to temporarily disable the "sync" for Desktop clients for the periods of frequent changes (i.e., when doing computations locally that amount to frequent updates of the shared/synchronized files.
To do that, click on the Nextcloud dashboard icon, click on the dropdown arrow, and use on the _Pause syncs for all_ and then _Resume syncs for all_ menu item.

 * It also is possible to share more than one folder, or use more than one Nextcloud provider. The latter case would be when you want to access, for example, both Grex and ComputeCanada/Alliance Nextcloud instances. To do that, click on the Nextcloud dashboard icon, click on the dropdown arrow, and access "Settings" menu. In the dialog window, pick the Nextcloud instance (such as "_User / hpc.umanitoba.ca_" ) and _Add Folder Sync Connection_ ). Point to a folder that you'd like shared via this particular Nextcloud service and user.

> Make sure that you share only what information you want to share. Never share the entire home directory, for example. Follow UManitoba's Data Security Classification and IT Security policies when sharing data. 

The above steps are an example to be used on Mac OS. For other operating systems, please download the client and use instructions for the corresponding version of the Desktop client (Linux or Windows). Please refer to Nextcloud [user manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/33/Nextcloud_User_Manual.pdf) and [online](https://docs.nextcloud.com/) documentation.
