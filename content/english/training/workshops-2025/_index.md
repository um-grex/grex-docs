Join us for the spring 2025 high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud workshop, open to all researchers from Manitoba institutions. The workshop will be in-person and take place at the University of Manitoba (Fort Garry campus). This is a great opportunity to learn about local (Grex) and national (The Alliance) research computing infrastructure in Canada, and to enhance your skills and efficiency using HPC and OpenStack cloud systems.

__What to expect:__ The workshop will feature a mix of talks and hands-on sessions, covering topics such as:

> - Introduction to BASH and Linux shell scripting.
> - Beginner’s tutorial on using the SLURM scheduler and Lmod for software modules.
> - Interactive computing with Open OnDemand and Jupyter Notebooks.
> - Introduction to the Globus file transfer service.
> - Getting started with the community OpenStack cloud.

* __Dates:__ May 21–23, 2025

> - May 21, 10 AM - 3 PM
> - May 22, 10 AM - 3 PM
> - May 23, 10 AM - 12 PM

* __Location:__ Room 204, Robson Hall, University of Manitoba (Fort Garry campus).

* __Registration:__ The Workshop is free, but RSVP via [EventBrite](https://eventscalendar.umanitoba.ca/site/science/event/high-performance-computing-workshop-6/) is required.

* __Optional:__ If you do not have already a CCDB account, registering at ccdb.alliancecan.ca few days prior to the workshop.
