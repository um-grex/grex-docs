## The Alliance support
---

<!--
The single point support contact for Compute Canada is [mailto:support@tech.alliancecan.ca](mailto:support@tech.alliancecan.ca "mailto:support@tech.alliancecan.ca")
-->

The single point support contact for the Alliance is __support@tech.alliancecan.ca__

Emailing to this address will create a __support ticket__ in the Alliance ticketing system (Help Desk). We support both local (Grex) and National resources through the Alliance support ticketing system. This is the main support contact for our HPC group and it is a preferred method (as compared to contacting an HPC analyst directly). If you use your UManitoba email address (email registered in CCDB) to contact the Alliance support, it will reach us faster because the system will automatically detect it and assign your user name to the generated ticket.

You can also open a web interface to the ticketing system [OTRS](https://support.computecanada.ca/otrs/customer.pl "Ticketing system - customer interface"). This requires actually having an Alliance account to access it, so it can be less useful for inquiries on how to get an [account.](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/account-management/apply-account "Apply for an account")

> * __support@frdr-dfdr.ca__ for Federated Data Repository [FRDR](https://www.frdr.ca/repo/ "FRDR").
> * __globus@tech.alliancecan.ca__ for issues related to Compute Canada's [Globus](https://globus.computecanada.ca/ "Globus") file transfer.

More information on the Alliance (formerly known as Compute Canada) support can be found [here.](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical_support "Technical Support")

We support both local (Grex) and National resources through the Alliance (Compute Canada) support ticketing system.

## IST Helpdesk
---

We have an HPC group in IST's Help Desk system __support@umanitoba.ca__ called Cherwell, so the tickets opened in this system will reach us, especially if you clearly state that they are HPC or Alliance related. More info on the [IST Help Desk](http://umanitoba.ca/ist/help/ "IST Help Desk") website.

## In person training sessions and workshops
---

You can book an in-person session (face to face meeting or online). We help new users for getting started on the systems we support, or for solving a specific problem that is harder to do over email, or for a consultation about Grex or the resources provided by the Alliance.
