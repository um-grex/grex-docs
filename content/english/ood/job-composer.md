## Job Composer
---

The Job Composer is an interface to create and submit jobs via OOD. It is accessible from the menu __Jobs ==> Grex JobComposer__. 

Once launched, it shows the applications that are already configured:

{{< /collapsible >}}

At the time of writing this page, there are two categories:

* Generic applications to create slurm scripts.

* Specific job composer for some applications like Gaussian, GROMACS, ORCA, MATLAB and R. 

More application could be configured and added to the JobComposer interface.
