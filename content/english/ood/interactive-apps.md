## Introduction
---

For the common applications used on Grex, we have addedd separate [interactive applications](ood/#interactive-apps) to make it easier for users. Some of these applications are: Gaussview, Matlab, Mathematica, Relio, Paraview, OVITO, ... etc. Some of the applications may not show up in your dashboard as they are protected with a POSIX group. For example, if you do not have access to [Gaussian](specific-soft/gaussian), __Gaussview__ will not show up in your dashboard. Some applications like stata, metashape are commercial. Therefore, they are set only for the groups who purchased the license. 

When launching these applications, they start automaticall the corresponding program, like for matlab interface, Gaussview interface. They are all configured to work like __Grex Desktop__ with two exceptions:

* They start automatically the interface without having to start a terminal, then load a module and start the interface. Everything is pre-configured to start automaticaly top open the interface.
* For some of the applications, there is also a possibility to choose which module to use. It is another step in the form where other resources are set. 

Here are some snapshots for Gaussview, Matlab, Paraview:
