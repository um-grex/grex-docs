## OSC OpenOnDemand on Grex
---

Grex's OOD instance runs on **aurochs.hpc.umanitoba.ca** . It is available only from UManitoba IP addresses -- that is, your computer should be on the UM Campus network to connect. 

To connect from outside the UM network, please install and start [UManitoba Virtual Private Network](https://umanitoba.ca/computing/ist/connect/virtualpn.html). OOD relies on in-browser VNC sessions; so, a modern browser with HTML5 support is required; we recommend Google Chrome or Firefox and its derivatives (Firefox, for example).

**Connect to OOD using [UManitoba VPN](https://umanitoba.ca/computing/ist/connect/virtualpn.html):**

> - Make sure Pulse Secure VPN is connected
> - Point your Web browser to [https://aurochs.hpc.umanitoba.ca](https://aurochs.hpc.umanitoba.ca) 
> - Use your Compute Canada username and password to log in to Grex OOD.

OOD expects user accounts and directories on Grex to be already created. Thus, new users who want to work with OOD should first connect to Grex normally, via SSH shell at least once, to make the creation of account, directories, and quota complete. Also, OOD creates a state directory under users' ``/home`` (__/home/$USER/ondemand__) where it keeps information about running and completed OOD jobs, shells, desktop sessions and such. Deleting the __ondemand__ directory while a job or session is running would likely cause the job or session to fail.

 - It is better to leave the __/home/$USER/ondemand__ directory alone!
