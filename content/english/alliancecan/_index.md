## Introduction
---

Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance) is a Canadian National Digital Research Infrastructure (__DRI__) organization (formerly known as Compute Canada). It provides the eligible researchers with the research computing resources such as several High-performance computing (HPC) systems with a large curated HPC [software stack](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Available_software), private OpenStack cloud, and [Globus](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus) data transfer software. 

The Alliance also maintains a user authentication service and usage database called CCDB. On Grex, we rely on CCDB for accessing our system. The first step to get started with Grex is to [**register**](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/account-management/apply-account "Apply for an account") for an Alliance account at the CCDB website (if you do not already have one).

## The Digital Research Alliance of Canada on the Web

- Digital Research Alliance of Canada [official website](https://alliancecan.ca/)
- The Alliance database [CCDB](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/ "Compute Canada accounts database")
- The Alliance user documentation [Wiki](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki "the Alliance user documentation Wiki") 
- Status page for the Alliance [clusters](https://status.alliancecan.ca/ "Status page for the Alliance services and platforms")

## Getting an account with the Alliance
---

University of Manitoba Faculty members are eligible for getting an account with the Alliance. Once it is obtained, they can manage accounts of their group members in CCDB.

If you are a postdoc, a student or an external collaborator, you can apply for an account as part of the Faculty's group. You will need your PI's CCDB role identifier code (CCRI). For more information, please [follow this guide](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/account-management/apply-account "Apply for an account").

The account will allow you to manage your roles and groups in CCDB, to access National HPC and Cloud machines, as well as few other services such as [Globus](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus "Globus") and [NextCloud](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Nextcloud "NextCloud"). 

Since we have switched Grex to CCDB credentials in late **2019**, the CCDB account is both necessary and sufficient to access Grex.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
* The old WestGrid accounts are no longer needed, nor working on Grex. 
* The WG portal will be decommissioned in the near future.
* If you still have data on ownCloud, please move it to [nextCloud](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Nextcloud/en), a similar service to ownCloud. This later will be decommissioned in the near future. 
* The old WestGrid DNS names are no longer valid nor used on Grex.
