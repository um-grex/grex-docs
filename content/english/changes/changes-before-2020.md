## Grex defunded since April 2, 2018
---

Since being defunded by WestGrid (on April 2, 2018), Grex is now available only to the users affiliated with University of Manitoba and their collaborators. The old WestGrid documentation, hosted on the WestGrid website became irrelevant after the Grex upgrade, so please visit Grex’s New [Documentation](/). Thus, if you are an experienced user in the previous “version” of Grex, you might benefit from reading this document: Description of Grex [changes](changes/linux-slurm-update).
