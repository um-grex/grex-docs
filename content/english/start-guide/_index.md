## Grex
---

Grex is an UManitoba High Performance Computing (HPC) system, first put in production in early 2011 as part of __WestGrid__ consortium. Now it is owned and operated by the University of Manitoba. Grex is accessible only for UManitoba users and their collaborators.

## A Very Quick Start guide
---

1. Create an account on [CCDB](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/security/login "CCDB"). You will need an institutional Email address. If you are a sponsored user, you'd want to ask your PI for his/her __CCRI__ code {Compute Canada Role Identifier}. For a detailed procedure, visit the page [Apply for an account](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/account-management/apply-account "Apply for an Alliance account").

2. Wait for half a day. While waiting, install an SSH client, and SFTP client for your operating system.

3. Connect to **grex.hpc.umanitoba.ca** with SSH, using your username/password from step 1.

4. Make a sample job script, call it, for example, __sleep-job.sh__ . The job script is a text file that has a special syntax to be recognized by SLURM. You can use the editor __nano__ , or any other right on the Grex SSH prompt (vim, emacs, pico, ... etc); you can also create the script file on your machine and upload to Grex using your SFTP client or scp.

{{< snippet
    file="scripts/jobs/templates/sleep-job.sh"
    caption="sleep-job.sh"
    codelang="bash"
/>}}
{{< /collapsible >}}

5. Submit the script using sbatch command, to the __compute__ partition using:

{{< highlight bash >}}
sbatch --partition=compute sleep-job.sh
{{< /highlight >}}

6. Wait until the job finishes; you can monitor the queues state with the 'sq' command. When the job finishes, a file slurm-NNNN.out should be created in the same directory.

7. Download the output slurm-NNNN.out from grex.hpc.umanitoba.ca to your local machine using your SFTP client.

8. Congratulations, you have just ran your first HPC-style batch job. This is the general workflow, more or less; you'd just want to substitute the __sleep__ command to something useful, like __./your-code.x your-input.dat__ .
