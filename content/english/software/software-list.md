## Software available on the CCEnv software stack on Grex.

Grex receives the ComputeCanada/Alliance software environment via CVMFS. Full autogenerated list of software is available at the [Available Software page](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Available_software) on the Allince Documentation Wiki.
> Note that Grex does not install local, commercial software licensed only to the National/Alliance systems. The software listed under "List of globally-installed modules" is available. 

## Software available on the SBEnv software stack on Grex.

Below is the auto-generated list of software modules available on Grex's local SBEnv software stack. 
> Note that many items on this list, most notably for commercial software, are available only to the licensed software owners/research groups of that software! Please use __module spider__ , __module help__ and __module load__ commands to check if a particular software module can be loaded by your group.

The list is updated periodically. The most authoritative method to check for available software is still __module spider__ as described on the Using Modules page.
