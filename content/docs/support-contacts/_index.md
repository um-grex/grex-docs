## ComputeCanada support

The single point support contact for Compute Canada is [support@computecanada.ca](mailto:support@computecanada.ca "mailto:support@computecanada.ca"). 

Emailing to this address will create a "support ticket" in the Compute Canada ticketing system. We support both local (Grex) and National resources through Compute Canada support system. This is the main support contact for our HPC group and it is a preferred method (as compared to contacting an HPC analyst directly). If you use your UManitoba email address (email registered in CCDB) to contact Compute Canada support, it will reach us faster because the system will automatically detect it.

You can also open a web interface to the ticketing system [Compute Canada OTRS](https://support.computecanada.ca/otrs/customer.pl "Ticketing system - customer interface"). This requires actually having a Compute Canada account to access so it can be less useful for inquiries on [how to get the account](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/account_application "CCDB - Apply for an account").

__To sum it all up: the main way to contact us is: [mailto:support@computecanada.ca](mailto:support@computecanada.ca "mailto:support@computecanada.ca")__

Secondary support contacts in the Compute Canada that are useful for particular services:

{{< hint info >}}
* [cloud@computecanada.ca](mailto:cloud@computecanada.ca "mailto:cloud@computecanada.ca") for Cloud support.
* [frdr@computecanada.ca](mailto:frdr@computecanada.ca "mailto:frdr@computecanada.ca") for Federated Data Repository [FRDR](https://www.frdr.ca/repo/ "FRDR").
* [globus@computecanada.ca](mailto:globus@computecanada.ca "mailto:globus@computecanada.ca") for issues related to Compute Canada's Globus file transfer.

We support both local (Grex) and National resources through Compute Canada support ticketing system.

## IST Helpdesk

We have an HPC group in IST's HelpDesk system [support@umanitoba.ca](mailto:support@umanitoba.ca "mailto:support@umanitoba.ca") called Cherwell, so the tickets opened in this system will reach us, especially if you clearly state that they are HPC or Westgrid related. More info on the [IST Helpdesk](http://umanitoba.ca/ist/help/ "IST Helpdesk") website.

## In person training sessions and workshops

You can book an in-person session (face to face meeting). We help new users for getting started on the systems we support, or for solving a specific problem that is harder to do over email, or for a consultation about Grex or Compute Canada resources.
